air attack.  Prohibitively expensive and should

@PEDIAIMPROVE28
The Germans have the option of destroying their 
own ports to prevent them from falling into Allied
hands.  If the Allies capture a port intact, they
receive a 1x bonus of 3x Battle Groups.  As D-Day
approaches the Germany player would be wise to
consider destroying their own ports.  This has a 
large malus to fuel (100 fuel points per turn)
to discourage wide-spread abuse.
